## Features ðŸ§ª
Typical digital forensic software functionalities were created, acting as the core concepts of the game. <br>
Allowing players to carry out realistic forensic tasks commonly performed within real investigations. <br>
The art is kept light-hearted and simplistic to allow for a wide range of individuals to play.

Using a dialogue-based, story-driven gameplay to educate the players on typical digital forensic investigative processes such as:
- Bagging and unbagging evidence
- Filling out the chain of custody form, emphasising its importance
- Producing a forensic image file from the physical evidence collected
- Verifying file integrity using hash algorithms; MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512
- Hex Viewer functionalities; searching for file signatures, as well as selecting and saving blocks to manually carve image files
- Analysing metadata from files extracted using the hex-viewing capabilities
- End of level quizzes, used to reiterate important information learnt
